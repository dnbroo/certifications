# I Passed the CompTIA Network+ on 11/23/24! üéâ  

**Score:** 740/900 (Passing score: 720)  
**Study Time:** ~50-60 hours  

I dedicated a significant amount of time preparing for this certification. I took a week off work, I spent most of my days studying. Additionally, I used a few evenings the week before and after to review weak areas and reinforce my knowledge.  

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the study materials I used, ranked from most to least helpful:  

---

## 1. Professor Messer‚Äôs Network+ YouTube Playlist (N10-008) + Study Groups  
This resource was the backbone of my study plan.  

- Messer‚Äôs videos were engaging and included animations that made complex concepts easier to grasp. I watched most videos at 1.25x speed.  
- While I initially planned to use reading materials, I found that watching videos helped me stay more focused.  
- **Subnetting Method:** Instead of using Messer‚Äôs "7-second subnetting" approach, I used my own method:  

    ```plaintext
    128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1  
     7     6    5    4    3   2   1   0  
    ```

    - The top row represents the number of hosts per subnet. Subtract the value in the chosen column (e.g., 32) from the bottom row to determine the CIDR notation.  

    My prior experience with binary math from college computer science courses made this method intuitive.

## 2. Jason Dion‚Äôs Practice Exams (Udemy)  
These practice exams were incredibly helpful, albeit tougher than the actual exam.  

- I never scored above 73% on them.  
- They highlighted gaps in my knowledge, allowing me to research and review those areas.  
- The challenging nature of these exams made the real test feel more manageable.

## 3. ChatGPT  
ChatGPT was a fantastic tool for clarifying tricky concepts like subnetting.  

- I used it to break down complex topics, generate practice questions, and test my knowledge immediately.  
- For example, asking *‚ÄúWhy do we need subnetting?‚Äù* helped me understand its purpose and use cases. This added context made concepts easier to retain.

## 4. Quizlet  
Quizlet‚Äôs flashcards and "Learn" feature were invaluable for memorization, particularly for port numbers.  

- I rarely pay for services, but I made an exception here to access its advanced learning tools, which sped up the process significantly.

## 5. Mike Meyers‚Äô Network+ All-in-One Exam Guide (8th Edition)  
This book was detailed and well-written, with great metaphors to explain technical concepts.  

- However, it was too time-consuming to get through all the material. Instead, I used it as a reference after completing Messer‚Äôs videos and Dion‚Äôs practice exams.  

---

## 6. Google (and Gemini)  
Google searches were a mixed bag. While they provided quick answers, the AI-generated results occasionally included inaccuracies.  

- I stuck to reputable sources and avoided relying on vague or questionable information.

# Key Takeaways:  
- Prioritize interactive and engaging resources, like videos and practice exams, over dense reading material (unless you‚Äôre a book learner).  
- Customize your study approach to your strengths‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs developing your own subnetting method or leveraging flashcards for rote memorization.  
- Use multiple resources to fill gaps in understanding and reinforce learning.  

If you‚Äôre preparing for the Network+ (or any other certification), good luck! Feel free to reach out with questions‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy to help!
